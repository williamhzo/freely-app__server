## General info

This project was built from scratch in 10 days, in the frame of Ironhack's Web Development's bootcamp. It has been awarded 'Best Web Development App' of the Hackshow (140+ people), on 25th May 2020.

### Freely. Where freelancers connect — and team up.

There are a lot of freelancer platforms out there, but most of them are targeted at big companies looking to save costs with inexpensive labor. We wanted to build a freelancer platform that serves freelancers, not corporations.

That’s why we made Freely. It’s a place where freelancers can meet, share ideas, and team up.

#### How does it work?

##### 1. Put Yourself Out There

First, create a profile. This will let other freelancers discover you. It serves as your introduction and portfolio.

##### 2. Connect With Other Freelancers

Browse profiles and projects to see what other freelancers are working on. If you see someone working on something that interests you, send them a message. You can offer to collaborate, or just have a conversation.

##### 3. Create Something

Do you have a great idea that you need some help with? Post a project. Include information about the project: what you have in mind, what roles and skills you need, and how you envision collaborating.

#### Who are we?

We are William Hermozo and Sam Littlefair. We’re students at the Ironhack Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in Paris, France. We created Freely for our final project. As of May 25, we are both looking for positions as web developers.

If you’d like to get in touch, you can find us on our profiles: [Sam Littlefair](https://github.com/samlfair) and [William Hermozo](https://github.com/williamhzo/).
